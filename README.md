# Quiz
## This is assignment number 4. 
### For this assignment I was tasked with making a functioning quiz using mainly javascript.
### The quiz is simple. It is Call of Duty trivia based, since that is a game I play quite frequently and thought it would be fun to make a quiz based around it.
### Here are the rules:
1. You have 1 minute and 20 seconds to answer all the questions
2. There are 5 questions total.
3. Each question wrong 10 seconds gets deducted from your timer effecting your final score.
4. Your score is based off of time remaining on the clock.

### Once the quiz is completed you will be directed to a submit page to insert your initials. There is a secondary page available to view the local highscores on your computer. You can reset all the scores on your local storage as well by pressing the reset button. Once done you can press the return button to take the quiz again and get a higher score!
